# Final Report — YugabyteDB Distributed Connector (Poco C++)

## Purpose and Goals
Build a reusable C++ connector library that integrates with YugabyteDB (PostgreSQL-compatible) using Poco C++ Libraries. Deliver a clean API for connection, querying, data modification, and error handling; provide docs, tests, and performance notes.

## Key Design Decisions
- Poco::Data + PostgreSQL connector for DB access; Poco::Net/JSON reserved for future features.
- Components:
  - YBConnectionManager: manages `Poco::Data::Session`, connect with retries.
  - YBQueryExecutor: executes SELECT and DML; returns `YBResultSet`.
  - YBResultSet: cursor-style iteration and typed getters; also supports legacy row-vector access.
  - YBErrorHandler: centralizes classification/formatting; op-aware error logging.

## Implementation Summary
- Day 1: Project setup, CMake, headers/sources, docs, example main.
- Day 2: Parameterized connection with retries; structured errors; connection tests.
- Day 3: Data retrieval; `executeSelect`, typed `YBResultSet`; query test.
- Day 4: Data modification; `executeInsert`, `executeUpdate`, `executeDelete`; storage test; idempotent upserts.
- Day 5: Integration test; documentation expanded (README, Architecture, summaries); minor optimizations.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Windows linker file locks: avoided by renaming outputs and relocating binaries.
- PostgreSQL placeholders: switched from `?` to `$1, $2, ...` for prepared statements.
- CMake Poco/PostgreSQL targets: added `find_package(PostgreSQL REQUIRED)` to satisfy imported target.

## Optimization Techniques
- Prepared statements with `use(...)` bindings.
- Reuse a single `Session` per process or thread where appropriate; plan a pool for concurrency.
- Bounded retries for connection; future: SQLSTATE-based transient retry policy and exponential backoff.
- Logging hooks for query and modification errors; future: configurable log levels.

## Future Improvements
- Connection pooling with shard/topology awareness.
- Transaction management helpers and idempotency patterns.
- AI-assisted query optimization or caching layer.
- Telemetry: tracing, metrics, structured logs.
