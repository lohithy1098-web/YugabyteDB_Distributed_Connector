# YugabyteDB Distributed Connector — Project Summary

## Overview
A C++ library using Poco C++ that provides connection, query, and data modification capabilities for YugabyteDB (PostgreSQL-compatible), with structured error handling and tests.

## Modules
- YBConnectionManager: connection lifecycle, retries.
- YBQueryExecutor: SELECT and DML execution APIs.
- YBResultSet: cursor iteration and typed getters.
- YBErrorHandler: error classification and operation-aware logging.

## Performance Highlights
- Prepared statements with positional parameters ($1, $2, ...).
- Session reuse; future: pooling and shard-aware routing.
- Bounded retries for connection.

## Lessons and Next Steps
- Windows builds may lock EXEs; adjust output paths or names.
- Prefer positional placeholders for PostgreSQL.
- Next: add transaction management helpers, connection pooling, and optional AI-based query tuning/caching.
